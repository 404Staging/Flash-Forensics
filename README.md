# Flash-Forensics

Helping ITs identify problems faster!

# Purpose

Have you ever been helping a remote user and needed some “basic information” of the system you are working with them on? Then you learn you can’t remote in, and the user is struggling to provide the information you need ?  

That is where Flash Forensics comes in! It is a collection of multiple scripts designed to gather common points of data from a windows workstation. Dump the findings into separate CSV files then bundle all those files into one ZIP file. Enabling the user to hopefully send the ZIP file your way via email, chat, ect… Helping to speed up the discovery process and get you and the user started on remediating the issue. 

# Build Methodology

Flash-Forensics comes as a lightweight EXE file that doesn’t require installation or any additional features. The project was designed, broken, then redesigned to be light and mobile. Enabling you to send it to the affected user and hopefully get back information you need to help them fix the issue(s).

The main file FlashForensics.py uses TKinter for a simple GUI that pulls in other modular python code segments to collect information for the workstation. 

As a fellow IT, the one question I get asked a lot by security professionals is how do you know the code in this EXE is safe? Well since this project is open source you can just look at it! All the current python segments are available in this repo.
